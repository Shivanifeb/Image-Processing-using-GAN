# Image-Processing-using-GAN
## Overview of project
Image processing techniques have witnessed significant advancements in recent years, driven by the rise of deep learning and neural networks. Two prominent algorithms in this field are ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) and DeOldify. ESRGAN focuses on upscaling low-resolution images to higher resolutions, while DeOldify specializes in adding realistic colors to grayscale or faded images. This project aims to explore the capabilities of both algorithms and their combined application in enhancing and colorizing images.

## Objective of project
1. Upscaling using ESRGAN:
Develop or utilize an ESRGAN model to enhance the resolution and details of low-resolution images.
Explore and experiment with different ESRGAN architectures, loss functions, and training strategies to improve the quality of upscaled images.
Evaluate the performance of the ESRGAN model by comparing the upscaled images with their original low-resolution counterparts and other upscaling techniques.

2. Colorization using DeOldify:
Utilize the DeOldify technique to add color to black-and-white or faded images, restoring them to a more vibrant and realistic appearance.
Investigate and employ appropriate pre-trained DeOldify models or train custom models using relevant datasets.
Experiment with different colorization strategies, such as grayscale-guided or reference-based colorization, to achieve accurate and visually pleasing results.
Evaluate the colorization performance by comparing the colorized images with the original colored images or ground truth data, if available.
